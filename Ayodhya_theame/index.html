      <h5>The Ayodhya Ram Mandir, also known as Lord Shri Ram Temple, is a Hindu temple located in Ayodhya, Uttar
        Pradesh, India. The temple has been the center of a long-standing religious and political dispute in India. The
        new Hindu temple at Ram Janm Bhumi is being built, and Hindus worldwide are excited about its opening. We have
        all the info about the Ayodhya Ram Mandir opening in 2024. It's set to open on January 24, 2024, and Prime
        Minister Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate it. Ayodhya, where the temple is, is considered a sacred place as
        it's the birthplace of lord Shri Ram. The temple is expected to be completed on February 24, 2024.

        Once they announce the opening date, they will start allowing people to book tickets for a visit. To do that,
        you'll need to register for the Ayodhya Ram Mandir visit in 2024. This registration is essential if you want to
        see the new Ram Mandir once it's finished.

        In this article, we will explore more about the history, architecture, significance, and how to reach the
        Ayodhya Ram Mandir.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="mt-2" style="color: #0059b3;"> History of Ayodhya Ram Mandir</h4>
      <h5>
        The history of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir is centuries-old. The temple is built on the site believed to be the
        birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most revered Hindu deities. The temple was demolished by the Mughal emperor
        Babur in the 16th century and a mosque was built in its place. The mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, stood on
        the site for centuries until it was demolished in 1992 by Hindu nationalists, triggering widespread violence and
        communal tensions in the country.

        The Ayodhya dispute has been a contentious issue in Indian politics for decades. The dispute revolved around the
        ownership of the site where the Babri Masjid stood and whether it was the birthplace of Lord Ram. The dispute
        was finally settled by the Indian Supreme Court in 2019, which ruled in favor of the construction of a Ram
        Janmabhoomi temple on the site. The construction of the temple was undertaken by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth
        Kshetra, a trust formed by the Indian government to oversee the construction of the temple.

                <h3>2024</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">As of 2024, Ayodhya's timeline reflects continued efforts towards the construction of
                  the Ram Mandir. Following the Supreme Court's verdict in favor of the temple's construction in 2019,
                  ongoing work includes architectural planning, fundraising, and construction activities. The city
                  remains a hub of religious pilgrimage and cultural celebrations, with events such as Ram Navami and
                  Diwali attracting devotees. Additionally, initiatives to enhance infrastructure and tourism facilities
                  are underway to accommodate the increasing influx of visitors. Ayodhya continues to hold profound
                  significance in Hindu mythology and remains at the forefront of India's cultural and religious
                  landscape.</p>

                <h3>2023</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">In 2023, Ayodhya experienced a significant milestone with the inauguration of the Ram
                  Mandir, marking the culmination of decades-long legal and religious disputes. The grand ceremony drew
                  millions of devotees and dignitaries from across the nation, symbolizing the fulfillment of a
                  longstanding Hindu aspiration. The event was accompanied by elaborate rituals, religious processions,
                  and cultural festivities, signifying Ayodhya's renewed status as a spiritual center. Amidst the
                  celebrations, the city also witnessed ongoing efforts for cultural preservation and tourism
                  development, aiming to showcase its rich heritage to visitors worldwide. The year marked a historic
                  moment in Ayodhya's legacy, resonating deeply with believers and observers alike.</p>

                <h3>2017</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">In 2017, Ayodhya witnessed continued legal proceedings and discussions surrounding the
                  Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid dispute, with the Supreme Court suggesting mediation for resolution. Hindu
                  organizations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, held rallies advocating for the construction of
                  the Ram Mandir, culminating in the 'Dharma Sabha' in September. Routine religious ceremonies
                  persisted, with festivals like Diwali celebrated fervently. However, no significant breakthroughs
                  occurred in the dispute resolution. The city maintained its cultural vibrancy with ongoing pilgrimages
                  and preparations for religious events like Ram Navami. Despite ongoing tensions, Ayodhya remained a
                  focal point of religious and legal deliberations throughout the year.</p>

                <h3>2016</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">In 2016, Ayodhya remained entangled in the Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid dispute, with legal
                  proceedings continuing in the Supreme Court of India. Various Hindu organizations intensified their
                  calls for the construction of the Ram Mandir, organizing rallies and meetings to rally support.
                  Efforts for an out-of-court settlement gained traction, with the Supreme Court urging parties to
                  explore mediation. Routine religious ceremonies and pilgrimages characterized the city's ambiance,
                  contributing to its spiritual significance. However, amidst ongoing discussions and legal battles, a
                  resolution to the longstanding dispute remained elusive. Ayodhya remained a symbol of religious and
                  cultural significance, drawing attention both nationally and internationally.</p>

          <h3>Diwali </h3>
          <h6>
            In a monumental announcement, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Maharashtra state president Chandrashekhar
            Bawankule has revealed India’s ambitious plan to host the world’s largest Diwali celebration in Ayodhya on
            January 22, 2024. The grand event is expected to draw 1.5 lakh devotees from Maharashtra over the next eight
            months, showcasing a remarkable spectacle at the Shri Ram temple.
            The declaration was made during a ceremony dedicated to honoring contributors to the ‘Selfie with Meri Mati’
            initiative, a part of ‘Meri Mati, Mera Desh,’ in collaboration with the Department of Higher and Technical
            Education and National Service Scheme (NSS). This initiative recently achieved recognition in the Guinness
            World Records for its outstanding participation.

          <h3>Ram Navami</h3>
          <h6>
            This festival celebrates the birth of Lord Rama who is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. This festival is
            celebrated during the time of March-April (the 9th day of the first month of the Hindu calendar). Lord Rama,
            who became king of Ayodhya, was known for His exemplary qualities. He was popular, brave, kind, just,
            intelligent, patient, loving, obedient and dutiful.
            Lord Rama is always worshiped with his consort Sita, brother Lakshmana and devotee Hanuman. The worship of
            Lord Rama is accompanied by the worship of the Sun god since Ram was considered to have descended from the
            sun, or is in the Solar dynasty. Ram Navami celebrations include reading the great epic Ramayana and staging
            plays of the Ram Lila, or the pastimes of the life of Lord Rama.

          <h3>Ram Janmabhoomi Temple</h3>
          <h6>
            The Ram Mandir (lit. 'Rama Temple') is an under-construction Hindu temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India.
            Many Hindus believe that it is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, a
            principal deity of Hinduism.[6][7]

            The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid mosque, which was built between 1528 and 1529. The idols
            of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.[8][9][10]
            In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for
            construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur to construct a mosque.[11] The
            court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence
            of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.[12]

            On 5 August 2020, the bhumi pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the
            construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.[13] The temple complex,
            currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. On 22
            January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajman (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and performed
            the prana pratishtha (transl. consecration) of the temple.[14][15] The prana pratishtha ceremony was
            organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.[16][17]

            The temple has attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its
            major activists, and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

          <h3>Hanuman Garhi Temple</h3>
          <h6>
            Hanuman Garhi Temple, located in the heart of Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to
            Lord Hanuman, the mighty monkey god. The temple, perched atop a hillock, is one of the most prominent
            landmarks in Ayodhya and holds immense significance in Hindu mythology and religious beliefs.

            The temple's architecture is characterized by its four-sided fort-like structure, with massive walls and
            bastions surrounding the main sanctum. Devotees ascend a flight of stairs to reach the inner sanctum, where
            a large idol of Lord Hanuman is enshrined in a sitting posture, adorned with garlands and offerings.

            Legend has it that Hanuman Garhi Temple was established by a saint named Sant Shri Jagannath Das Ji Maharaj,
            who was an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman. According to popular belief, visiting the temple and offering
            prayers to Lord Hanuman is believed to bestow blessings, protection, and strength upon devotees, fulfilling
            their wishes and overcoming obstacles.
            The temple attracts a large number of pilgrims and devotees throughout the year, especially on Tuesdays and
            Saturdays, considered auspicious days dedicated to Lord Hanuman. Besides religious significance, Hanuman
            Garhi Temple also offers panoramic views of Ayodhya city, making it a popular tourist destination.
